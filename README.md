# Setup Windows

This is my step to step for setting up developer environment computer (windows 11/colorful laptop edition)

----

## Before install new operating system
Make sure to backup any importain files

- Enable Sync (vscode setting/extension)
- Work Relate stuffs
- Public/Private Keys
- Large files/folders (if your internet is slow)

----

## After install operating system/recovery

1. update windows
2. if no more windows update, pause the update
3. install all latest driver
4. resume the update, if you see any attempt that windows try to downgrade the driver, remember the driver/update name and hit pause again
5. use ``wushowhide.diagcab`` to hide any downgrade windows update
6. resume windows update to see if it's work
